# Project Analysis: reflex-ksys

## Overview
`reflex-ksys` is a web application built using the Reflex Python framework, designed for monitoring and visualizing time-series data. It functions as a dashboard, providing real-time snapshots, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), trend analysis, and technical indicators for various data tags.

## Key Technologies
*   **Framework:** Reflex (Python web framework)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (indicated by `psycopg` dependency), likely integrated with TimescaleDB for efficient time-series data handling.
*   **Frontend:** Reflex components with styling from `styles.css` and leveraging TailwindCSS (configured via `rxconfig.py`).
*   **Dependencies (from `requirements.txt`):**
    *   `reflex==0.8.6`
    *   `psycopg[binary,pool]>=3.1`
    *   `pydantic>=2.6`
    *   `cachetools>=5`

## Core Features
1.  **Latest Snapshot Display:** Shows current values, timestamps, communication status, and alarm states for various data tags.
2.  **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Provides aggregated metrics (count, min, max, first, last, delta) for tags over user-selectable time windows (e.g., 1 min, 24 hours, 7 days).
3.  **Trend Analysis:** Interactive line charts for individual tags, allowing users to visualize historical data trends. Options to display average, minimum, maximum, last, and first values within a selected time window.
4.  **Technical Indicators:** Visualizes technical indicators such as Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Bollinger Bands (BB) on tag data.
5.  **Auto-Refresh:** Configurable auto-refresh for trend data, enabling near real-time monitoring.
6.  **Security:** Includes a dedicated `security.py` module for startup security validation and Content Security Policy (CSP) header management.
7.  **Error Handling:** Basic error and loading state handling for improved user experience.

## Project Structure Highlights
*   **`ksys_app/`**: The main application directory.
    *   **`components/`**: Contains reusable UI elements like `kpi_tiles`, `gauge`, `features_table`, etc.
    *   **`states/`**: Manages application state using Reflex's state management system (e.g., `dashboard.py`, `trading_state.py`).
    *   **`queries/`**: Likely responsible for database interactions and data retrieval.
    *   **`api/`**: Contains `gauge.py`, potentially for API endpoints related to gauge data.
    *   **`models/`**: Defines database models.
    *   **`security.py`**: Implements security-related functionalities.
*   **`scripts/`**: Houses various utility scripts (e.g., `env_check.sh`, `qc_export.py`).
*   **`data/`**: Stores data files, such as `influx_qc_rule.csv`, possibly used for quality control or data ingestion.
*   **`docs/`**: Contains project documentation.
*   **`SuperClaude_Framework/`**: A separate framework present in the directory, but its direct integration with the `reflex-ksys` application's core functionality is not immediately apparent from the analyzed files. It might be a separate project or a library used for other purposes within the broader repository.

## Conclusion
`reflex-ksys` is a robust monitoring dashboard built with Reflex, focusing on efficient time-series data visualization and analysis, with an emphasis on security. Its modular structure facilitates maintainability and scalability.
